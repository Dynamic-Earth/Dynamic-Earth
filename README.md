- Hi, we're @Dynamic-Earth
- This is the account for Dynamic Earth's fledgling attempts at direct participation with the software development community!
- Dynamic Earth is the mining and geology branch of Science North's organization. 
- We are looking to potentially collaborate on topics in the fields of mining, earth sciences, or STEAM education.
- You can reach me at aslaney@sciencenorth.ca
